Plan:
-> Connect to DB
	|-> Report Errors if Necessary
-> Store last time database was updated
	|-> If it was within 5 seconds, wait 5 seconds and test again.
	|-> Else see if it is currently being updated.
		|-> Wait 5 seconds and try again.
-> Define eZe variables
-> Cycle through each controller
	|-> Cycle through each input for each controller
		|-> Pull data from eZe and store to a two dimensional array
-> Cycle through all data and push to DB.
-> Change the last DateTime updated to the last DateTime Grabbed from eZe.
-> Restart

		
Points to talk about:
Do we need to average or test for data that is out of range?
	PointSettings: Min (op. val), Max, % Change, Conditions (check if on)
How strict are our 5 second interval requirements?
